# Pulse: An Open-Source Game Engine

Welcome to Pulse!
The project is aimed at creating a free and open-source game engine. Pulse is written in C++ and is designed to be easy to use, while providing a rich feature set for game development.

## Why Pulse?

Pulse was born out of a desire for learning and exploration. It's a project that embraces the spirit of open-source, believing that sharing knowledge and learning from each other is the key to creating great things. Pulse is more than just a game engine, it's a learning journey, and you're invited to join us on this exciting adventure.

## Features

Pulse is still in its early stages, but we're working hard to build a robust and versatile game engine. Here are some of the features we're planning to implement:

- **Rendering**: High-quality rendering capabilities.
- **Physics Engine**: Realistic physics simulation.
- **Audio System**: Comprehensive audio controls for immersive sound design.
- **Input Handling**: Support for various input devices.
- **And much more**: We have big plans for Pulse, and we're just getting started.
