# Contributing to Pulse

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Pulse! It's people like you that will make Pulse such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request, addressing (with `@`) a maintainer (someone with commit access) in the description of the pull request.

If you've started to work on a longer, more involved feature, start a conversation on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pulse) first.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork Pulse and create a branch with a descriptive name.
